🚀 ECommerce Shopping Website CI/CD Pipeline | Ultimate DevOps Project 🚀

I led the implementation of a highly efficient CI/CD pipeline tailored for an ECommerce shopping platform, optimizing development and deployment processes across 11 microservices.
🔗 Branch Per Microservice Strategy Adopted a branch-per-microservice model, ensuring granular version control, streamlined team collaboration, and simplified maintenance workflows.
🛠️ Jenkinsfile Integration Integrated Jenkins files directly into each microservice repository, facilitating tailored pipeline configurations and seamless CI/CD execution.
🔄 Automated Pipeline Triggering Configured multibranch pipeline automation with generic webhook triggers, enabling dynamic activation of CI workflows with reduced manual intervention.
🏑️ Docker Image CI Pipelines Engineered 11 independent CI pipelines for Docker image builds, ensuring uniformity and reliability in containerized application artifacts.
🛳️ Automated Docker Image Pushing Streamlined artifact delivery by automating the push of Docker images to container registries post-build, significantly reducing operational overhead.
🚀 Terraform for IAC Utilized Terraform to define and provision cloud infrastructure as code, including EC2 instances, security groups, and an EKS cluster, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments.
🌐 Kubernetes-Driven Deployments Leveraged Kubernetes manifests for declarative application deployment across multiple environments, enabling scalable, automated rollouts and seamless microservice orchestration.
